##Using following command to invoke openlane:<br>
```bash
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a
```

### Synthesis
   
 To run the Synthesis
   
    ```bash
       run_synthesis
    ```

to check wheather the synthesis is donr or not:

```bash

       Flop Ratio = No. of D FlipfLops/Total No. of cells
      
                   =1613/14876
      
                   =0.10842
      
        Percentage of D FF's = 10.842%
        

 ## Day2 Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells
   
 ## Floorplanning and Intro to Library Cells
 
```bash
  run_floorplan
```

- Press 'Esc' to enter command mode.
- While in command mode press 'i' to enter edit mode and then type the code which is given below.
- After editing is done press 'Esc' to once again enter command mode.
- Now type ':wq' and press enter to save and exit from file.

```bash
set ::env(CLOCK_NET) $::env(CLOCK_PORT)
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) 65
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) 4
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) 3
```

To see the actual layout after the flow, we have to open the magic file by adding the command

```bash
magic -T /home/vsdsquadron/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef 
  read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &

run the spice file in ngspice

```bash
 ngspice sky130_inv.spice
```

To plot the graph between Voltage and time type the command in ngspice

'plot y vs time a'

after running this file we get output of ngspice like this,

# DRC Corrections and rules

For doing DRC coorection we have to download lab files using

```bash
   wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/archive/drc_tests.tgz
```

![33](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/495f11bb-7199-4ac2-bbfc-cf195b67bf94)

To start magic tool,we can use command

```bash
  magic -d XR
```

And we will open 'met3.mag' file

![34](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/7a1d604f-f9eb-46e1-a774-35334c353334)

We can see contact cuts using:
```bash
cif see VIA2
```
![35](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/172d5019-7ed2-4135-8ac4-c08e112d6602)

# Fixing ploy.9 error

![36](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/eb327277-9a35-4416-8463-9e559402319f)


![37](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/d2309835-f2e2-4975-bdcb-8c2e0dad564e)

Now we run `tech loadsky130A.tech`  and do drc check using `check drc`


![38](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/e2208a81-d333-4eec-bd15-20ff85cca63f)

Now executing the command `drc style drc(full)` and `drc check`

DAY 4: Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree

#We are transforming grid data into lab data in this lab.

We can access the track file from the directory displayed in the picture to get additional details.

![45](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/29c218c2-cb08-43b0-931b-5580f4c69965)

The track, which is essentially a trace of metal layers like metal 1, metal 2, etc., is utilized during the routing stage.

Since PNR is automated, we must designate the destinations for the trips. Tracks provide this specification. For layers li1, metal 1, and metal 2, each track is positioned at (0.23, 0.46)um in the horizontal direction and (0.17, 0.34)um in the vertical direction.

The ports are located on the li1 layer in the layout. We must translate the grid into the tracks in order to guarantee that the ports are at the intersection of the tracks.

We may accomplish this by opening the tracks file first, then the tkcon window and entering the help grid command.


![46](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/c5044940-e6b0-4c53-a8fa-64a75046a342)


![47](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/b761e50a-8868-48eb-acb1-3c663de941f1)


![48](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/a07beec5-ad25-4eb3-95bb-1077b049bf28)


As we can see, the ports have been positioned near the track intersection. However, three boxes are covered in between the lines. Therefore, this also fits our second requirement.

Lab steps to convert magic layout to std cell LEF

![49](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/da5659c0-108d-47be-9736-9e7b6740d227)


![500](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/4cbd330f-3b32-4b2f-acb3-9174e0e086d3)


now we will open this file in magic using
```bash
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_vsdinv.mag &
```

now we have to run command lef write in takon window to extarct the lef file

![51](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/ae281bbf-1aee-444a-935a-fd75a395a017)

we will need to move the files to the src folder where all design files are available.

To do this we can copy the file using 'cp' comman

![52](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/c402c501-2783-4e7f-bf62-bad68b847130)


![53](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/f0acf5fa-f6b3-4456-adb5-998af7c34879)

OPENLANE :- Now we will go to the open lane directory and execute the docker command.

Will Execute the following commands in a line

#OPENLANE

Now we will open openlane directry and run 'docker' command

./flow.tcl -interactive

package require openlane 0.9

prep -design picorv32a

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]

add_lefs -src $lefs

run_synthesis

prep -design picorv32a -tag 08-04_18-39 -overwrite

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]

add_lefs -src $lefs


![54](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/5e2b59c5-6d17-4a94-9200-71405fa6358c)

```bash
  run_synthesis
```

![56](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/de61c672-dd8d-4695-9788-5994d0684823)


#adjusting synthesis parameters to incorporate vsdinv and fix slack

The README.MD file in the configuration directory will be changed.


![57](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/361977c0-b66b-46fe-abce-54937df15fb3)


Now we will run the following commands in openlane:


`echo $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)`

`set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"`

`echo $::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING)`

`echo $::env(SYNTH_SIZING)`

`set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1`

`echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)`

`run_synthesis`


![58](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/490fd4b4-4a55-49f4-8b08-1b049d1ec94c)


```bash
 run_synthesis
```

![60](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/02b760e2-b44b-4adf-907a-b762bfdf68a9)

#To resolve the issue

'init_floorplan'

'place_io'

'tap_decap_or'

![61](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/e04ec5b9-80a4-4480-9a0c-f18e5275d41c)

Now that errors have been successfully fixed, the 'run_placement' command is being used.


![64](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/dffeee1e-d709-4a39-b2db-e7bdae083777)

```bash

To view internal layers we need to run command 'expand' in tckon tab

![67](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/3981813b-76bf-46a3-8d86-10a8bcc68c59)

OpenLANE lacks a SPEF extraction tool, hence this procedure must be completed externally to OpenLANE.

You may find the generated.spef file in the routing folder, which is situated beneath the results folder.
