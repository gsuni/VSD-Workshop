### Synthesis
   
 To run the Synthesis
   
    ```bash
       run_synthesis
    ```

       Flop Ratio = No. of D FlipfLops/Total No. of cells
      
                   =1613/14876
      
                   =0.10842
      
        Percentage of D FF's = 10.842%
        

 ## Day2 Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells
   
 ## Floorplanning and Intro to Library Cells
 
```bash
  run_floorplan
```

- Press 'Esc' to enter command mode.
- While in command mode press 'i' to enter edit mode and then type the code which is given below.
- After editing is done press 'Esc' to once again enter command mode.
- Now type ':wq' and press enter to save and exit from file.

```bash
set ::env(CLOCK_NET) $::env(CLOCK_PORT)
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) 65
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) 4
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) 3
```

To see the actual layout after the flow, we have to open the magic file by adding the command

```bash
magic -T /home/vsdsquadron/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef 
  read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &

run the spice file in ngspice

```bash
 ngspice sky130_inv.spice

To plot the graph between Voltage and time type the command in ngspice

'plot y vs time a'

after running this file we get output of ngspice like this,

rise time= (2.2489 - 2.181)e-09 = 66.92 psec

- Fall time

fall time= (4.0951 - 4.0526)e-09 = 42.51 psec

- Propagation delay

- Cell fall delay

cell fall delay =(4.07735 - 4.04988)e-09 = 27.47 psec

# DRC Corrections and rules

For doing DRC coorection we have to download lab files using

```bash
   wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/archive/drc_tests.tgz
```


To start magic tool,we can use command

```bash
  magic -d XR
```

And we will open 'met3.mag' file

We can see contact cuts using:
```bash
cif see VIA2
```

DAY 4: Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree

#We are transforming grid data into lab data in this lab.

We can access the track file from the directory displayed in the picture to get additional details.


![Screenshot (625)](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/202d0cc1-d237-43bd-b21a-d9c8279b33f3)


The track, which is essentially a trace of metal layers like metal 1, metal 2, etc., is utilized during the routing stage.

Since PNR is automated, we must designate the destinations for the trips. Tracks provide this specification. For layers li1, metal 1, and metal 2, each track is positioned at (0.23, 0.46)um in the horizontal direction and (0.17, 0.34)um in the vertical direction.

The ports are located on the li1 layer in the layout. We must translate the grid into the tracks in order to guarantee that the ports are at the intersection of the tracks.

We may accomplish this by opening the tracks file first, then the tkcon window and entering the help grid command.


![Screenshot (624)](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/74322a53-a987-4f82-85ec-2d02dff12d00)

As we can see, the ports have been positioned near the track intersection. However, three boxes are covered in between the lines. Therefore, this also fits our second requirement.

Lab steps to convert magic layout to std cell LEF

now we will open this file in magic using
```bash
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_vsdinv.mag &
```

now we have to run command lef write in takon window to extarct the lef file

![Screenshot (631)](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/7ea30992-8a2c-4eea-86a3-b44247d02f4f)

we will need to move the files to the src folder where all design files are available.

To do this we can copy the file using 'cp' comman

![Screenshot (632)](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/aa186324-86a4-4e8a-8c15-b42146bb5817)


OPENLANE :- Now we will go to the open lane directory and execute the docker command.

Will Execute the following commands in a line
```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```

Commands to view and change parameters to improve timing and run synthesis

```tcl

prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]

Now that our custom inverter is properly accepted in synthesis we can now run floorplan using following command

```tcl
# Now we can run floorplan
run_floorplan
```
![Screenshot (11)](https://github.com/gsuni/VSD-Workshop/assets/99734954/52b1a7a5-1f33-4aef-a3fa-82d2eae414d8)

Since we are facing unexpected un-explainable error while using `run_floorplan` command, we can instead use the following set of commands

```tcl
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or
```
